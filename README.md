## Mocky
#### Mock your HTTP responses to test your REST API

Mocky is a simple app which allows to generate custom HTTP responses. <br />
It's helpful when you have to request a build-in-progress WS, when you want to mock the backend response in a singleapp, 
or when you want to test your WS client.


## Is Mocky online?

Yes, Mocky is online, free and unlimited!

## Mocky on my own server?

You can easily install Mocky on your own server.
You just need... a JVM!

Quick steps to install Mocky
* Install [PlayFramework 2.1.1](http://downloads.typesafe.com/play/2.1.1/play-2.1.1.zip) ([instructions](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/Installing)) in your dev environment.
* Clone Mocky
* Configure the app in `conf/application.conf`. The main setting is the `version` key. You have 3 different repositories where you can store your mocks:
 * v1: mocks are stored on gist. Nothing is needed, it's free, but limited to 200 requests / hours.
 * v2: mocks are stored in mongodb. Don't forget to fill the `mongodb.uri` key.
 * fs: mocks are stored on your filesystem (in the `data` dir. by default).
* If you want to launch mocky in dev mode, just launch `play run`.
* If you want to use mocky on a server, launch `play dist`, copy the generated zip to your server, unzip it and launch `./start` (easy, ain't it?)
